# Walmart Store Vs. State GDP

This repository includes everything that was made to test whether the number of walmart stores within a certain state correlates to how large a certain state's Gross Domestic Product is.

## Overview

In this project, we investigated the relationship between the number of Walmart stores in each U.S. state and the corresponding state-level GDP. By merging and analyzing data from Walmart’s public store distribution and state GDP statistics, we aimed to explore whether economic strength correlates with retail presence. Overall, we wanted our findings to highlight how data visualization and correlation analysis can offer practical insights for business strategy, retail planning, and economic geography. This analysis may assist retailers or policy makers in identifying market opportunities or evaluating how commercial infrastructure aligns with economic activity.

### Interesting Insight

It was the most visible within the bar graph, but we found that states like New York and New Jersey showed lower-than-expected store counts despite having large economies.
